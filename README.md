Introducing Grocemate: Your favorite smart recipe book!

The idea for Grocemate was born when I wanted to take a picture of a recipe and have my phone instantly create a grocery list for me based on that recipe. This app is currently a work in progress but here are some fun screens and demos:

Features:

- Maintain a digital library of your recipes
- Scan a recipe from a cookbook or import a picture and Grocemate will automatically format and import it for you!
- Only have the ingredients? Through the power of LLMs, Grocemate will fill in the recipe steps for you.
- Your data is stored on your phone and synced with iCloud.
